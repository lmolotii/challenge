# Introduction

The goal of the current task is to check your ability to create simple applications based on the algorithms.

# Challenge

1. The program, gets the text as a source of input. You can find the following example here:
```
The resources will be created in your default Digital Ocean project. The project/folder could be created in the custom way.
```

2. The program should output TOP 5 most frequently used words
```
the - 2
be - 2
in - 2
created - 2
project - 2
```

# Rules

Actually, you can change any code inside the solution. Hovewer, the part of job is already done in files:
```
WordCounter.cs
WordParser.cs
```

# Execution advices

Try to be sure, that your solution provides:
1. Effective algorithm 
 - from code perspective (as less code as possible)
 - from memory and CPU effectiveness (validation could be skipped) -> **this one is the goal of the task**.

2. Validation of input data (only ASCII letters and numeric symbols (0-9), and following symbols `,`,`(`,`)`,`-`,`_`,`+`, `.`,`!`,`?`, `"`,`#`,`@`)
